\chapter{Introduction}

In the ever-evolving realm of data management, a unified framework is essential to provide a structured environment for seamless integration and management of diverse data sources. Dataspaces are a concept that provides this unified view of data sources, enabling organizations to utilize each other's data.

\section{Dataspaces}

In today's data-driven landscape, the importance of creating a framework, where organization can utilize each other's data is sigificant.

\subsection{IDSA}

The \ac{IDSA} created a \ac{RAM}\cite{ids-ram} to provide this structured environment for seamless integration and management of diverse data sources.

\subsection{Prometheus-X}

Prometheus-X is a project that aims to provide a reference implementation of the \ac{RAM}.

\section{Blockchain}

Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records the provenance of a digital asset. It is immutable and tamper-proof, making it an ideal technology for recording transactions.
